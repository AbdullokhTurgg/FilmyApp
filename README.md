## Libraries

### Android Jetpack ...

* [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) View binding is a
  feature that makes it easier for you to write code that interacts with views.

* [Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle) An interface
  that automatically responds to lifecycle events.

* [Room](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room?gclsrc=aw.ds&gclid=Cj0KCQiA09eQBhCxARIsAAYRiyl9xrvsl7MKTcUVF73v6FB8EQyG-U8YVwhZyhA5rzq2UhpBvOUOUuEaAr5jEALw_wcB)
  The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer on top of SQLite, providing more
  reliable access to the database while simultaneously using all the features of SQLite.

* [Paging 2](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging) Swap Library helps
  to load and display small pieces of data at the same time. Downloading partial data on demand
  reduces the use of network bandwidth and system resources.

* [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation?gclsrc=aw.ds&gclid=Cj0KCQiA09eQBhCxARIsAAYRiymyM6hTEs0cGr5ZCXOWtLhVUwDK1O86vf8V_Uq2DWvVYNFZwPFznzAaAllMEALw_wcB)
  Navigation refers to interactions that allow users to navigate through , enter, and exit various
  parts of the content in your app. Navigation component Android Jetpack helps you navigate, from
  simple button clicks to more complex templates like application panels and navigation bar. The
  navigation component also provides a consistent and predictable user interface, adhering to an
  established set of principles.

* [Coroutines Flow](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) Data
  objects that notify views of changes to the underlying database.


* [Kotlin flows](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-flow/)
  In coroutines, a flow is a type that can emit multiple values sequentially, as opposed to suspend
  functions that return only a single value. For example, you can use a flow to receive live updates
  from a database.

* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) Data related to
  the user interface that is not destroyed when the application is rotated. Easily schedule
  asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.

### DI

* [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) Hilt is a
  dependency injection library for Android that reduces the execution time of manual dependency
  injection into your project. Performing manual dependency injection requires that you create each
  class and its dependencies manually, and use containers to reuse and manage dependencies.


* [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation?gclsrc=aw.ds&gclid=Cj0KCQiA09eQBhCxARIsAAYRiymyM6hTEs0cGr5ZCXOWtLhVUwDK1O86vf8V_Uq2DWvVYNFZwPFznzAaAllMEALw_wcB)
  Navigation refers to interactions that allow users to navigate through , enter, and exit various
  parts of the content in your app. Navigation component Android Jetpack helps you navigate, from
  simple button clicks to more complex templates like application panels and navigation bar. The
  navigation component also provides a consistent and predictable user interface, adhering to an
  established set of principles.
### Image

* [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) Glide is a fast and efficient open source media
  management and image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk
  caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface.
### Network

* [Retrofit2](https://github.com/square/retrofit) Type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.

* [OkHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp) HTTP + HTTP/2 client for Android and Java applications.

* [Parse-SDK-Android](https://github.com/parse-community/Parse-SDK-Android) A library that gives you
  access to the powerful Parse Server backend from your Android app. For more information about
  Parse and its features, see the website, getting started, and blog.
### Coroutines

* [Kotlin Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) Coroutines is a rich library for
  coroutines developed by JetBrains. It contains a number of high-level primitives with support for
  coroutines, which are discussed in this guide, including startup, asynchrony, and others.
* [Circular Progress View](https://github.com/VaibhavLakhera/Circular-Progress-View) A customisable
  circular progress view for android.

* [Push Down Animation Click](https://github.com/nontravis/pushdown-anim-click) A library for
  Android developers who want to create "push down animation click" for view like spotify
  application. :)
* [Expandable TextView](https://github.com/Manabu-GT/ExpandableTextView) ExpandableTextView is an
  Android library that allows developers to easily create an TextView which can expand/collapse just
  like the Google Play's app description. Feel free to use it all you want in your Android apps
  provided that you cite this project.

* [Shimmer](https://github.com/facebook/shimmer-android) Shimmer is an Android library that provides
